extends Trail
class_name AutoTrail

## A special kind of [Trail] that has the ability to be [method cut]. Whenever an AutoTrail is cut,
## a disappearing copy is dropped onto the host's parent, and the current trail is started anew.
## AutoTrails are also automatically cut when there's a sudden jump (configured via [member
## long_segment_min_length]) or the AutoTrail exits the tree.

## When the trail is cut, the copy that's leaft behind will disappear by shrinking at this rate (px/s).

## The trail is automatically cut when there's a sudden jump that's longer than this value (px).
